# ling-blocos

This is a starter for an assignment for my Object Oriented Programming course, which consists of developing a Scratch-like (Scratch is a block-based programming language for teaching kids to program) software for programming with blocks. It includes elements of image editing software (like Inkscape), such that each geometrical shape can be programmed to make different moves (up, down, grow, etc.).

The students had to complete the software. This repository contains only the starter project, but there are many thing done here which were made during class.

For the more complete á¹•roject programmed by the students: https://github.com/adilsonfcosta/ling-blocos
